NOTE: precreate_snapshot_inst.sh is no longer needed. Meta data user
is created as part of every HDB installation due to Czar maintenance
of some HDB_ tables.


This file documents the scripts in this directory:


cr_trigs.sql: Creates the primary key triggers on each of the ref_ tables 
whose primary keys can be assigned automatically. Created manually at
installation by copying all ref_ triggers from MASTER_SITE/cr_trigs.sql

create_snapshot_inst.sh: The driver script which calls all other scripts to
set up a snapshot installation.

destroy_snapshot_inst.sh: Undoes a snapshot installation. Out of date.

disable_hdb_fk.sql: Disables all original foreign keys which point to
original hdb_ tables (rather than snapshots). Creates disable_hdb_fk_script.sql.
MUST RUN USING @, not <

drop_snap_fk.sql: Drops all foreign keys which point to snapshots. Creates
drop_snap_fk_script.sql. MUST RUN USING @, not <

enbl_con.sql: Enables all original foreign keys which point to hdb_
tables. Creates enbl_con_script.sql. MUST RUN USING @, not <

metaDataUser.ddl: Creates the user meta_data_user.

new_hdb_fk.sql: Creates foreign keys which point to snapshots. Creates
new_hdb_fk_script.sql. MUST RUN USING @, not <

ref_refresh_monitor.sql: Creates the table ref_refresh_monitor.

refresh_hdb_snap.sql: Creates the procedure refresh_hdb_snap, for refreshing
snapshots.

run_refresh_hdb_snap.sql: Creates run_refresh_hdb_snap, which puts
refresh_hdb_snap on the job queue.

snap_de.sql: De-installs a snapshot installation. Queries the DB to 
automatically handle the objects it needs to handle.

snap_ins.sql: Called by create_snapshot_inst.sh; does the bulk of the work of
creating a snapshot installation. Queries the DB to automatically handle
the objects it needs to handle.

v_grant.sql: Grants meta_data_user select on v$parameter; required for some
forms.
