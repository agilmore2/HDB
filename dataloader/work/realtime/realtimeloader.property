#  this file is the standard property file used for communication to various java dataloader applications
#  the general use of this file is to communicate and define variables to the code similar to the way Unix
#  environmental variables were utilized in the past.  Deletions or erroneous entries in this file could lead to
#  program termination, unpredictable program operation or unpredictable database results
#
#  any line that begins with the pound sign (#) is considered a comment and with have no effect on
#  the performance of the java programs
#
#  the following line defines the driver code that the java routines will utilize
# generally this line should not be modified 
DRIVER=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

# The url is the important entry that tells the java jdbc code where to connect to the oracle database
#be sure to enter the correct server name : port : sid 
# typical examples in our community:
URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:uchdb2


# The username is the oracle username that will be used to connect to the system
# for HDB2  generally this will be the owner of the datatables
# enter the DBNAMEDBA here ie
USERNAME=app_user

#  enter the oracle password for this account  ie
#PASSWORD=master
PASSWORD=XXXXXX

#  NOTE:  an alternative to entering each of these names correctly is to enter the associated id
# for each respective lookup table.  In general either method will produce the same results
# ie... collection_system_id=5  

#  the collection system name will be the same as the name for where the data comes from
# valid collection_system_names can be found in oracle table hdb_collection_system  ie
collection_system_name=Hydromet Dayfile Mailbox
#collection_system_name=

#  The computation_name is the name for how this data was computed
# Valid entries for this field can be found in oracle table hdb_computed_datatypes
computation_name=N/A
#computation_name=

#  The agen_name is the agency that this data ultimately belongs to. 
#  Valid entries for this  field can be found in oracle table hdb_agen 
agen_name=Bureau of Reclamation
#agen_name=Multiple Agencies

#  The method name would be the data collection technique used in the acquisition of this data
#  Valid entries for this field can be found in oracle table hdb_method
method_name=unknown
#method_name=

# The loading_application_name is the name of the application that is currently running and is loading data
# into the database
# Valid entries for this field can be found in oracle table hdb_loading_application
#loading_application_name=Hydromet Archive File Loader
#loading_application_name=Hydromet Dayfile Loader
loading_application_name=Real Time Data Loader


# variable location is utilized for site specific applications
# site files have been found to differ and the programs must know at what site they are being utilized
#location=YAKIMA
#location=LC
location=UC
#location=

#email address for responsible party. This should be the same as the environment variable
# $HDB_XFER_EMAIL
#emailaddr=agilmore@uc.usbr.gov
# So, in the invocation of the dataloader, we will do -Demailaddr=$HDB_XFER_EMAIL instead of setting
# this property separately

#socket for the realtime dataloader to listen to, both upper and lower case, just in case. :)
socket=4322
SOCKET=4322

#don't log extra debug stuff
debug=N

#don't log all SDI lookup failures.
LOG_ALL=N

#current code looks for "interval" and if it is not defined sets "INTERVAL" so set both to avoid lookup
interval=instant
INTERVAL=instant
