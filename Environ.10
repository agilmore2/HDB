# This file defines constants which are used in HDB application makefiles.
# It must be placed in the HDB application root directory and must be 
# included ("include") in every application or library makefile which uses
# these constants.

# This version was added and Edited by M. Bogner, Sutron Corporation to
# use for compilations of pro*c code on the Linux machine and to use
